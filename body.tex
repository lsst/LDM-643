\section{Introduction}

As LSST DM moves from construction through commissioning and into operations 
a number of rehearsals have been proposed to help prepare for the execution 
of the survey.  Specific rehearsals are outlined in \citedsp{LDM-503} but in 
the larger cases, i.e., the Operations (Ops) Rehearsals (LDM 503-09, LDM 503-11, and 
LDM 503-12) the contents of that document alone, does not sufficiently outline 
the scope, content, action and interaction that are being rehearsed.  
From the software side, \citedsp{LDM-564}
summarizes the DM software features that should be available and helpfully 
identifies those software releases in the context of the rehearsals.  
However, the Ops Rehearsals are not simply periods to test hardware and 
software systems, they are opportunities to understand/develop operations 
processes and to observe the interactions of those hardware/software systems 
and people. 

This document, attempts to outline the Ops Rehearsals in greater detail, 
first because missing/late software features and hardware systems may 
require mitigation (e.g., shims, fake data, etc...) or might be grounds for 
postponement, second because the purpose of an Ops Rehearsal is not to debug 
a freshly deployed system but rather to understand whether that system does
what is needed, and third because the effort to carry out rehearsals will 
require coordination of persons/facilities. 

Note: The current draft attempts to level set this process for one Ops 
rehearsal (the first one).


\section{LDM 503-09: Operations Rehearsal \#1 for Commissioning}

\underline{Nominal Date:} April 2019

\underline{Original Description:}
Choose TBD weeks during commissioning. Pick which parts of plan we could 
rehearse.  Chuck suggests Instrument Signal Removal should be the focus 
of this (or the next rehearsal).

\subsection{An Updated Goal:}

The primary goal is to simulate nominal operations/observing for a 2--3 day 
period including the daily meeting(s) that would occur among the SciOps and 
Data Facility staff.  These activities will be accompanied by simulated 
observations obtained in a ``sampling" mode in order to exercise 1) the 
transfer, archiving and ingestion of raw data, 2) offline processing of 
calibrations and science data, and 3) curation of the resulting data products.
At the time of this initial rehearsal, we do not expect a functioning 
observatory system, instead:

\begin{itemize}[topsep=0pt]
\item Sampling mode has been used to describe early LSST commissioning 
observations where observations occur based on the needs of the commissioning 
team.  Such observations would typically include some basic set of calibrations
(e.g. bias/flat) followed by nighttime observations that might be used to 
test/investigate system performance.

\item A basic set of raw data will be transferred to a mountaintop computer 
which will then in turn mimic observations by sending those images from the
summit to NCSA via the long-haul networks.

\item The contents of the dataset will be minimal (no larger than the 
calibration and nightly observations that might be expected from ComCam).  
The current plan is to draw from a suitable set of test-stand data and 
then present these as though they were coming from the telescope.

\item On arrival at the LDF the observations will ingested into the current 
data-backbone which can in turn be used to feed the data through a batch 
production service to produce "calibrations" and "reduced science products."

\item In the context of this rehearsal, the sophistication (or correct-ness) 
of the pipeline(s) is not paramount.  What is important is that the raw and 
resulting products are tracked and can be superficially examined by LDF and 
SciOps team members.  The degree of realism would depend on both the data
being sent and availability of working pipeline tasks.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Pre-Requisites:}

There are three broad categories of pre-requisites that are needed: persons 
must be identified to fill roles within the rehearsals, services 
(or facsimiles) need to exist that will be used/tested throughout the 
rehearsal, and actions/work to prepare elements that would not otherwise 
be available in the pre-operations LSST project.

 
\subsubsection{Pre-Requisites: Roles:}

Persons need to be identified that will staff various roles in this 
rehearsal.  These roles are drawn from those in operations which come
from three groups: Observatory Operations (ObsOps), Science Operations 
(SciOps), and the LSST Data Facility (LDF).
\begin{itemize}[topsep=-8pt]
\item Coordinator:  This person acts as an independent executor of the 
rehearsal.  They would be responsible to outside actions that drive the 
simulation (e.g., initiating a script that would start data flowing from 
summit to LDF).
\item ObsOps, Observing Specialist
\item ObsOps, ???
\item ObsOps, ???
\item SciOps, QA Scientist
\item SciOps, Verification and Validation Scientist
\item LDF, Operator
\item LDF, QA Scientist
\item LDF, Admin
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Pre-Requisites: Services \& Service Components:}

The broader pieces of the DM system that need to operate for this rehearsal are:
\begin{itemize}[topsep=-8pt]
\item A service must operate at the mountaintop that will send data.  This can 
be as simple as a shell script that draws from a list of files and transfers 
them to NCSA with some cadence. 
\item The long-haul networks need to be available at the time of this rehearsal.
\item Data Backbone Endpoint: to receive and ingest incoming files.
\item Batch Production: A mechanism to distribute jobs to a compute resource 
to process the "new" data.
\item Workflow System:  To configure and launch jobs.
\item Pipeline(s): A set of software that processes the data.
\item Science Platform: A location where raw and processed products can be 
examined by staff.
\end{itemize}

Additional monitoring services for the networks, batch production, compute 
resource(s), and data backbone are desirable.

\subsubsection{Pre-Requisites: Work:}\label{prework}

Work that must be completed prior to Ops Rehearsal but which is not part of 
the DM development.
\begin{itemize}[topsep=-8pt]
\item Generate a mock data set.  This must have the ability to be ingested with 
either Gen2 or Gen3 Butler.  It is not necessary that the generated data 
products be curated for a long period.
\item Create shim service that sends data from summit to LDF.
\item Specify appropriate pipeline(s) that will be run during the rehearsal.
\item Test that services in the preceding section can adequately function 
for the purposes of this rehearsal.
\item Allocate compute and storage resources and specify location of stored 
products.
\item Location to record information about incidents, problem backlog, 
processing and QA summaries (for the initial test this could be as simple a 
set of confluence pages).
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Rehearsal Outline:}
During normal operations the time observing occurs depends on local nighttime
in Chile.  This is not necessary for the rehearsal so that data delivery and
can be shifted to occur in a normal working day.  Prior to the execution of 
the rehearsal the work outlined in Section~\ref{prework} must be completed
and tested.
%%\item Pre-checklist: Assemble proto-ops team, all component services 
%%from DM are ready with payloads, data sets, configurations, etc. 
%%(assumes pre-integration work).

A basic outline of the processes that would occur during for this rehearsal 
follows:
\begin{itemize}[topsep=-8pt]
\item (ALL: ObsOps+SciOps+LDF) Afternoon stand-up operations meeting.
\item (ObsOps) Mock transmit nightly cals to LDF for ingestion.
\item (LDF) Generate nightly calibrations.
\item (SciOps) Select configuration and calibrations.
\item (ObsOps) Mock transmit nightly science images and ingest
\item (LDF) Run science pipeline (.e.g. ISR) in offline/batch mode.
\item (LDF) Generate feedback on processing for discussion in stand-ups.
\item (SciOps) Examine input and output data from nightly observations and
processing.
\item (SciOps) Generate feedback for discussion in stand-ups.
\item (ALL) Monitor progress of nightly “campaigns,” characterize and assess, 
make records of failures, diagnose issues, generate problem backlog.
\item (ALL) Create mock nightly reports.
\item Repeat (a total of 3 times)
\end{itemize}

While there are "realistic" components within the outline, much of focus by 
the actors should be on the processes.  How is this going to look in 
day-to-day operations?  If there are problems, what happens?  Who gets a 
call and when?  What information needs to be available between a geographically
distributed team? (and when?)  Are the lines of communication between those
groups sufficient?

%\subsection{Software Products and Services Needed:}
%
%Based on the actions being undertaken in this rehearsal the following services are needed: 
%a shim for Camera DAQ and Archiving Services, Data Backbone Services (w/ minimal ability to make data visible to LSP), 
%and Batch Production Services with appropriate Pipelines.   
%These services are implemented within the following sofware products:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Batch Production Software (Michelle Butler)
%\item Science Pipeline Software (Robert Lupton)
%\item Supporting Software (e.g., Data Butler): (Jim Bosch)
%\end{itemize}
%Since many of these are in a nascent state, often a shim (or some user-driven actions) 
%may be needed to emulate some elements.
%
%\clearpage

\subsection{Assess:}

Among the activities in the Rehearsal Outline it is expected that some might influence the long-term development
within DM.  For example exercising tools/services (e.g. the LSP) with a mind toward operational needs.  Thought
toward the processes and metrics needed to make decisions about configuration, calibration selection, 
and production success/failure. 

\begin{itemize}
\item Was the rehearsal successful? How long did it take? What anomalies/failure modes were identified, and how did team cope? 
\item What fixes are needed, and on what timescale (e.g., next ops rehearsal, or we are go for commissioning)? 
\item What improvements in procedures, documentation, frameworks, systems, and algorithms were identified?
\item Budget time and effort to plan and execute priority changes and improvements, and plan for next rehearsal.
\end{itemize}
